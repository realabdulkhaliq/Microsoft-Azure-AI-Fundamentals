# Fundamentals of machine learning

Machine learning is in many ways the intersection of two disciplines - data science and software engineering. The goal of machine learning is to use data to create a predictive model that can be incorporated into a software application or service. To achieve this goal requires collaboration between data scientists who explore and prepare the data before using it to train a machine learning model, and software developers who integrate the models into applications where they're used to predict new data values (a process known as inferencing).

## What is machine learning?

Machine learning has its origins in statistics and mathematical modeling of data. The fundamental idea of machine learning is to use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes or values. For example:

The proprietor of an ice cream store might use an app that combines historical sales and weather records to predict how many ice creams they're likely to sell on a given day, based on the weather forecast.
A doctor might use clinical data from past patients to run automated tests that predict whether a new patient is at risk from diabetes based on factors like weight, blood glucose level, and other measurements.
A researcher in the Antarctic might use past observations automate the identification of different penguin species (such as Adelie, Gentoo, or Chinstrap) based on measurements of a bird's flippers, bill, and other physical attributes.

Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning that tries to emulate the way the human brain learns. The key to deep learning is the creation of an artificial neural network that simulates electrochemical activity in biological neurons by using mathematical functions.

### Microsoft Azure Machine Learning

Microsoft Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for training, deploying, and managing machine learning models. It's designed to be used by data scientists, software engineers, devops professionals, and others to manage the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning projects, including:

Exploring data and preparing it for modeling.
Training and evaluating machine learning models.
Registering and managing trained models.
Deploying trained models for use by applications and services.
Reviewing and applying responsible AI principles and practices.

#### Features and capabilities of Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities to support machine learning workloads:

Centralized storage and management of datasets for model training and evaluation.
On-demand compute resources on which you can run machine learning jobs, such as training a model.
Automated machine learning (AutoML), which makes it easy to run multiple training jobs with different algorithms and parameters to find the best model for your data.
Visual tools to define orchestrated pipelines for processes such as model training or inferencing.
Integration with common machine learning frameworks such as MLflow, which make it easier to manage model training, evaluation, and deployment at scale.
Built-in support for visualizing and evaluating metrics for responsible AI, including model explainability, fairness assessment, and others.
