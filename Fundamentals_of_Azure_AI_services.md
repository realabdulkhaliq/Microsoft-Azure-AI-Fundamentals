# Fundamentals of Azure AI services

Azure AI services are a portfolio of AI capabilities that unlock automation for workloads in language, vision, intelligent search, content generation, and much more. They are straightforward to implement and donâ€™t require specialist AI knowledge.

Azure AI services are based on three principles that dramatically improve speed-to-market:

Prebuilt and ready to use
Accessed through APIs
Available and secure on Azure

Azure AI services are available and secure on Azure
Azure AI services are cloud-based and accessed through an Azure resource. This means that they're managed in the same way as other Azure services, such as platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or a managed database service. The Azure platform and Resource Manager provide a consistent framework for all your Azure services, from creating or deleting resources, to availability and billing.

Trust is at the core of all of Microsoft's offerings, and security is at the center of Azure AI services. From cyberthreat prevention, to data privacy, to compliance, to safe digital experiences, Azure AI services provides enterprise-grade security.
