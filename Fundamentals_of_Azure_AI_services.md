# Fundamentals of Azure AI services

Azure AI services are a portfolio of AI capabilities that unlock automation for workloads in language, vision, intelligent search, content generation, and much more. They are straightforward to implement and donâ€™t require specialist AI knowledge.

Azure AI services are based on three principles that dramatically improve speed-to-market:

Prebuilt and ready to use
Accessed through APIs
Available and secure on Azure

Azure AI services are available and secure on Azure
Azure AI services are cloud-based and accessed through an Azure resource. This means that they're managed in the same way as other Azure services, such as platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or a managed database service. The Azure platform and Resource Manager provide a consistent framework for all your Azure services, from creating or deleting resources, to availability and billing.

Trust is at the core of all of Microsoft's offerings, and security is at the center of Azure AI services. From cyberthreat prevention, to data privacy, to compliance, to safe digital experiences, Azure AI services provides enterprise-grade security.

## Create Azure AI service resources

Azure AI services are cloud-based, and like all Azure services you need to create a resource to use them. There are two types of AI service resources: multi-service or single-service. Your development requirements and how you want costs to be billed determine the types of resources you need.

Multi-service resource: a resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to multiple Azure AI services with a single key and endpoint. Use the resource Azure AI services when you need several AI services or are exploring AI capabilities. When you use an Azure AI services resource, all your AI services are billed together.
Single-service resources: a resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a single Azure AI service, such as Speech, Vision, Language, etc. Each Azure AI service has a unique key and endpoint. These resources might be used when you only require one AI service or want to see cost information separately.
