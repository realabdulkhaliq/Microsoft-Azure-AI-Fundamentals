# Fundamentals of Facial Recognition

Face detection and analysis is an area of artificial intelligence (AI) which uses algorithms to locate and analyze human faces in images or video content.

There are many applications for face detection, analysis, and recognition. For example,

Social media - facial recognition can be used to automatically tag known friends in photographs.

Intelligent monitoring - for example, an automobile might include a system that monitors the driver's face to determine if the driver is looking at the road, looking at a mobile device, or shows signs of tiredness.

Advertising - analyzing faces in an image can help direct advertisements to an appropriate demographic audience.

Missing persons - using public cameras systems, facial recognition can be used to identify if a missing person is in the image frame.

Identity validation - useful at ports of entry kiosks where a person holds a special entry permit.

Security - facial recognition can be used in building security applications, and increasingly it is used in smart phones operating systems for unlocking devices.

**Face detection**
Face detection involves identifying regions of an image that contain a human face, typically by returning bounding box coordinates that form a rectangle around the face.

With Face analysis, facial features can be used to train machine learning models to return other information, such as facial features such as nose, eyes, eyebrows, lips, and others.

Facial recognition
A further application of facial analysis is to train a machine learning model to identify known individuals from their facial features. This is known as facial recognition, and uses multiple images of an individual to train the model. This trains the model so that it can detect those individuals in new images on which it wasn't trained.

## Get started with facial analysis on Azure

Microsoft Azure provides multiple Azure AI services that you can use to detect and analyze faces, including:

Azure AI Vision, which offers face detection and some basic face analysis, such as returning the bounding box coordinates around an image.

Azure AI Video Indexer, which you can use to detect and identify faces in a video.

Azure AI Face, which offers pre-built algorithms that can detect, recognize, and analyze faces.
