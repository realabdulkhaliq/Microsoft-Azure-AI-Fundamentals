# Computer Vision

Computer vision is one of the core areas of artificial intelligence (AI), and focuses on creating solutions that enable AI applications to "see" the world and make sense of it.

The ability to use filters to apply effects to images is useful in image processing tasks, such as you might perform with image editing software. However, the goal of computer vision is often to extract meaning, or at least actionable insights, from images; which requires the creation of machine learning models that are trained to recognize features based on large volumes of existing images.
