# Machine learning in Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning service - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple authoring experiences such as:

Automated machine learning: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

Computer Vision is an area of AI that deals with visual processing. Let's explore some of the possibilities that computer vision brings.

The Seeing AI app is a great example of the power of computer vision. Designed for the blind and low vision community, the Seeing AI app harnesses the power of AI to open up the visual world and describe nearby people, text and objects.
