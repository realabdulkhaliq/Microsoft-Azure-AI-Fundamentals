# Machine learning in Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning service - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple authoring experiences such as:

Automated machine learning: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.
