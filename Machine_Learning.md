# Machine learning in Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning service - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple authoring experiences such as:

Automated machine learning: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

Computer Vision is an area of AI that deals with visual processing. Let's explore some of the possibilities that computer vision brings.

The Seeing AI app is a great example of the power of computer vision. Designed for the blind and low vision community, the Seeing AI app harnesses the power of AI to open up the visual world and describe nearby people, text and objects.

Natural language processing (NLP) is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.

NLP enables you to create software that can:

Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

Document Intelligence is the area of AI that deals with managing, processing, and using high volumes of a variety of data found in forms and documents. Document intelligence enables you to create software that can automate processing for contracts, health documents, financial forms and more

**Generative AI** describes a category of capabilities within AI that create original content. People typically interact with generative AI that has been built into chat applications. Generative AI applications take in natural language input, and return appropriate responses in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and audio.
