# Types of machine learning

Supervised machine learning
Supervised machine learning is a general term for machine learning algorithms in which the training data includes both feature values and known label values. Supervised machine learning is used to train models by determining a relationship between the features and labels in past observations, so that unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases.

Regression
Regression is a form of supervised machine learning in which the label predicted by the model is a numeric value. For example:

The number of ice creams sold on a given day, based on the temperature, rainfall, and windspeed.
The selling price of a property based on its size in square feet, the number of bedrooms it contains, and socio-economic metrics for its location.
The fuel efficiency (in miles-per-gallon) of a car based on its engine size, weight, width, height, and length.

Classification
Classification is a form of supervised machine learning in which the label represents a categorization, or class. There are two common classification scenarios.

Binary classification
In binary classification, the label determines whether the observed item is (or isn't) an instance of a specific class. Or put another way, binary classification models predict one of two mutually exclusive outcomes. For example:

Whether a patient is at risk for diabetes based on clinical metrics like weight, age, blood glucose level, and so on.
Whether a bank customer will default on a loan based on income, credit history, age, and other factors.
Whether a mailing list customer will respond positively to a marketing offer based on demographic attributes and past purchases.
In all of these examples, the model predicts a binary true/false or positive/negative prediction for a single possible class.
