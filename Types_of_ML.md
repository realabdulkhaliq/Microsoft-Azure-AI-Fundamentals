# Types of machine learning

Supervised machine learning
Supervised machine learning is a general term for machine learning algorithms in which the training data includes both feature values and known label values. Supervised machine learning is used to train models by determining a relationship between the features and labels in past observations, so that unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases.

Regression
Regression is a form of supervised machine learning in which the label predicted by the model is a numeric value. For example:

The number of ice creams sold on a given day, based on the temperature, rainfall, and windspeed.
The selling price of a property based on its size in square feet, the number of bedrooms it contains, and socio-economic metrics for its location.
The fuel efficiency (in miles-per-gallon) of a car based on its engine size, weight, width, height, and length.

Classification
Classification is a form of supervised machine learning in which the label represents a categorization, or class. There are two common classification scenarios.
